Isolates from Mexico typically having two copies of each gene also tended to have two copies of each gene within several annotation categories.
Isolates from South America and US-1 typically had three copies of each gene and also tended to have three copies of each gene within annotation categories.
This indicated that CNV does not prefer particular gene classes.

%We used allele balance to explore CNV in other \textit{Phytophthora} genomes that were available at the SRA.
\vspace{5mm}

\textit{P. andina} and \textit{P. parasitica} appeared predominantly diploid.
\textit{P. parasitica} included minor peaks at the expectation for three copies.
Three out of the four \textit{P. capsici} samples appeared predominantly diploid but one appeared triploid.
This indicates that CNV occurs throughout \textit{Phytophthora}.
