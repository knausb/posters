Most emergences of \textit{P. infestans} may be ephemeral.
Occasional emergence of high fitness lineages displace preceding lineages.
Our work shows that these high fitness clones are also associated with high CNV.
This research also indicates a link between a copy number of two and a sexual mode of reproduction.
It is currently unknown whether a copy number of three drives fitness or it accumulates after highly fit lineages emerge.
It is also unknown if lineages of high copy number can revert back to a copy number of two.
